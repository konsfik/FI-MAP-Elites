I really like the work you have done, and really hope you will extend the mesher to take into consideration quadratic elements, and over time volume elements.\r<br />\n<br />\nMy question to you:\r<br />\nI have a mesh that I will like to smooth with the SimpleSmoother class (beta 4). But I have some points on the mesh that I will like to keep at their original position. Is this possible in the current version? If not; do you have any thoughts on an approach I can use to solve this problem?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you for the anware in advance.\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards\r<br />\nIsdas<br />\n",
