Segments similar to segment &quot;4&quot; are what I am wondering about.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe background is that I have a particular finite element boundary condition I would like to apply to any vertex that falls on segment 4.  I would also like to increase the chances of getting a few Steiner points along that line as the mesh is refined.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you as always.\r<br />\n<br />\n6 2 0 1\r<br />\n0 0 0 1\r<br />\n1 5 0 1\r<br />\n2 5 5 1\r<br />\n3 0 5 1\r<br />\n4 1 2 2\r<br />\n5 3 4 2\r<br />\n5 1\r<br />\n0 0 1 1\r<br />\n1 1 2 1\r<br />\n2 2 3 1\r<br />\n3 3 0 1\r<br />\n4 4 5 2\r<br />\n0<br />\n",

    "Html": "Yes, that's ok. If the segment is spilt during refinement, the new points/subsegments will be assigned the correct boundary mark 2, so it should be easy to identify them.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat i usually do, is splitting the segments before meshing (i.e. adding them to the input geometry), so I have more control over the final mesh layout.<br />\n",
