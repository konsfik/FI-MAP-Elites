    "Html": "I figured it out, soooooooooo stoked.\r<br />\nAs I was doing test cases, I noticed triangles were being split where I did not have points. I thought I had set minimum angle to 0, and I had, so why was this happening? I looked at the ConstraintOptions class and noticed the SegmentSplitting param. Sounds about exactly what I did not want on, so I set to 2. It worked. I tried on my &quot;large dataset&quot; way away from 0,0 and it worked perfect. I think my idea of no duplicate verts might be needed when segmentsplitting is on, but never tried it. Hopefully others benefit from my 8 hours playing around with this.\r<br />\n<br />\nI duplicated this post on the Github site, so I know its in two places, and I think its worth having it in both.\r<br />\nI sure wish I had the contact name of someone familiar with this set of code, I could hire them here and there and point them to others that would want their help too.\r<br />\nI still feel like I have not decently explored what triangle.net can do.<br />\n",
