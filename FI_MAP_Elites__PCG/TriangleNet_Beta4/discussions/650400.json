I need to create a concave polygon by knowing only the ordered list of contour vertices.\r<br />\nCurrently I add the vertices (points) into an InputGeometry, then I generate a Mesh from the InputGeometry using the Triangulate function. The mesh gets created, but obviously it's convex.\r<br />\nHope you can help me with this question. Thanks a lot! :)<br />\n",

Sorry for taking this long but I haven't yet had the chance to get back working on that particular project.\r<br />\n<br />\nTo better explain what I am trying to achieve, take a look at these two images. This is my current situation, where I generated a simple road network using some custom scripts and road data. There are a lot of overlapping triangles, but the overall road outline looks decent for my purpose.\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34085865/Immagini%20al%20volo/RoadBefore.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMy plan is to add all the road borders to Triangle.NET, and let it generate a mesh similar to the one in this picture (I approximated some polygons while editing the image, sorry):\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34085865/Immagini%20al%20volo/RoadAfter.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHow much of this is doable using Triangle.NET only? Thanks again for your time. :)<br />\n",
