    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nAgain; thank you for the great work on this project. It is really fun to see something this complex ported so easily and made so user friendly.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am wondering what the plan for the project is. It would have been great to have for instance quadrilateral elements as well as triangles.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've seen that you have made a quadratic element class in the documentation, but as far as I can understand this only uses the existing triangle mesh to generate quadratic elements. Is it then possible to get a structured grid?\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards\r<br />\nIsdas<br />\n",

It's not supposed to be used in production and in Beta 4 you would possibly use the <code>Otri</code> struct directly.<br />\n<br />\nBy structured gird you mean dividing the (quadratic) element into its corresponding 4 triangles? That's not supported by Triangle.NET, but shouldn't be too hard to implement.<br />\n<br />\nAnyways. If you decide to work on these subjects, feel free to come back here. Any contribution will be welcome ...<br />\n",
