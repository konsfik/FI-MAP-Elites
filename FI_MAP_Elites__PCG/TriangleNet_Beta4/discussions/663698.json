I'm trying to achieve this whenever the user selects a point or edge from a list in my app.<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",

But still it should be fairly easy to implement: add a &quot;selected objects&quot; manager to IRenderContext and add a layer to the LayerRenderer, that draws the selection on top of the other layers.<br />\n<br />\nThough you'd have to find clever way to do this effeciently (redrawing only the parts of the mesh that change during selection and deselection).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>EDIT</strong>: or write your own IRenderer (taking the LayerRenderer implementation as a reference) and inject it to the RenderManager.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>EDIT 2</strong>: thinking about it, the IRenderer Render() method should be virtual, so one could directly derive from LayerRenderer and override.<br />\n",
