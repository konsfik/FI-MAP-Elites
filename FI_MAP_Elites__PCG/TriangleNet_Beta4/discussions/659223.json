And I have some advice here.<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Make Triangle.NET Objects/APIs suitable for GPU rendering instead of the CPU methods in the demos/examples.</li>\n<li>Add a obj exporter. (Obj is a text-based 3D model file format.)</li>\n<li>Move the project to GitHub! <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79165/how-to-migrate-svn-repository-with-history-to-a-new-git-repository\" rel=\"nofollow\">It's easy!</a>.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the focus on the core functions. The demo is cool but I think there are more things left to do with the core Objects (<code>Vertex</code>, <code>Polygon</code>, ...) and APIs. <br />\nFor example, <code>class</code> shouldn't be used for small object. I should say <code>class</code> is abused in Triangle.NET. More infomation on that <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/521298/when-to-use-struct?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n</li>\n<li>What's the advantage compared to <a href=\"https://github.com/MaulingMonkey/poly2tri-cs\" rel=\"nofollow\">poly2tri-cs</a>?
