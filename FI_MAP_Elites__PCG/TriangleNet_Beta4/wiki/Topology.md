# Mesh Topology

If you create a mesh with Triangle.NET, the `Triangles` property allows you to access mesh topology. The property returns a collection of `ITriangle`. The interface provides the following properties and methods:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`P0, P1, P2`** | `int` | Gets the triangle's vertex ids. |
| **`N0, N1, N2`** | `int` | Gets the triangle's neighbor ids. |
| **`GetVertex(int)`** | `Vertex` | Gets the vertex at given index (where index may be 0, 1 or 2). |
| **`GetNeighbor(int)`** | `ITriangle` | Gets the neighbor at given index (where index may be 0, 1 or 2). |
| **`GetSegment(int)`** | `Segment` | Gets the segment at given index (where index may be 0, 1 or 2). |

Triangle vertices are listed in counterclockwise order. While `GetVertex` will always return a proper Vertex object, a neighbor might not exist if the triangle lies on the boundary of a domain. In that case, the `GetNeighbor` method will return `null`. The same holds for the `GetSegment` method, which will return `null`, if the specified edge is not constrained or not on the boundary.

The segment returned by `GetSegment(i)` (if not `null`) is the edge opposite of vertex `i`.

From the above graphic you can see, that

* N0 is the neighbor opposite to P0 (across the edge P1-P2)
* N1 is the neighbor opposite to P1 (across the edge P2-P0)
* N2 is the neighbor opposite to P2 (across the edge P0-P1)

To see some code which uses the topology information of the `ITriangle` interface, have a look at the [Quadratic Elements](Quadratic_Elements.md) example.

Internally, Triangle.NET uses the same [structures](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/tripaper/triangle2.html) as the original Triangle code, i.e. the Otri struct (_oriented triangle_). To get a better understanding of how the Otri primitives work, open the Mesh Explorer, go to _Tools_ menu and select _Topology Explorer_.
