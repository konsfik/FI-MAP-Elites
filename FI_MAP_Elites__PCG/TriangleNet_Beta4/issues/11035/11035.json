    "Description": "Using the latest development source, I was doing the folloing:\n* add a few vertices to a polygon p\n* perform p.Triangulate\n* add another vertex to p\n* perform p.Triangulate again\n\nThis currently fails with:\n\n```\nArgumentException: An element with the same key already exists in the dictionary.\nSystem.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[System.Int32,TriangleNet.Geometry.Vertex].Add (Int32 key, TriangleNet.Geometry.Vertex value) (at /Users/builduser/buildslave/mono-runtime-and-classlibs/build/mcs/class/corlib/System.Collections.Generic/Dictionary.cs:404)\nTriangleNet.Mesh.TransferNodes (IList`1 points) (at Assets/scripts/Triangle/Mesh.cs:446)\nTriangleNet.Meshing.Algorithm.Dwyer.Triangulate (IList`1 points) (at Assets/scripts/Triangle/Meshing/Algorithm/Dwyer.cs:79)\nTriangleNet.Meshing.GenericMesher.Triangulate (IPolygon polygon, TriangleNet.Meshing.ConstraintOptions options, TriangleNet.Meshing.QualityOptions quality) (at Assets/scripts/Triangle/Meshing/GenericMesher.cs:68)\nTriangleNet.Geometry.ExtensionMethods.Triangulate (IPolygon polygon, TriangleNet.Meshing.ConstraintOptions options, TriangleNet.Meshing.QualityOptions quality) (at Assets/scripts/Triangle/Geometry/ExtensionMethods.cs:43)\nDelauneyTest.Update () (at Assets/scripts/DelauneyTest.cs:57)\n```\n\nI guess the reason is related to the \"userId\" heuristic in Mesh.cs line 427. As a crude work-around I now enforce userId = false. Maybe the Polygon class should have a \"ResetVertexIDs\" method? In general it is a bit ugly that triangulate has a side effect on the input data.",
